The model-fixtures library makes it easy to work with test data stored
in json (or xml).

For example, if you have a Java Bean Class named People, you might
want to create a file named `people.json` that that contains test data
representing a bunch of people.

You can then use methods from this library to easy load the json
defined in `people.json` into a List<People> using the following: 

#+begin_src java
  JsonFixture<Person> personJsonFixture = new JsonFixture<Person>(Person.class);
  List<Person> people = personJsonFixture.allFixturesFromFile();
#+end_src

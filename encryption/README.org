** Encryption and Decryption

   To Encrypt/Decrypt values for properties files, download Jasypt
   1.9.0 from here: 
   
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/jasypt/files/jasypt/jasypt%201.9.0/

   Applications each have their own password that they use to
   decrypt messages at startup. 
   
   You'll need to know the password for the app in order to
   encrypt and/or decrypt messages. 

   Once you have the password, you can use the scripts inside the
   jasypt installation's bin directory to encrypt and
   decrypt messages. 

   Currently we're using the `PBEWithMD5AndDES` algorithm to encrypt
   passwords. 

   So, for example, if the application password is "secret" and you'd like
   to encrypt the message "4me2know":
   
#+begin_src sh
$ encrypt.sh input='4me2know' password='secret' algorithm='PBEWithMD5AndDES'


----ENVIRONMENT-----------------

Runtime: Oracle Corporation Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 23.3-b01 



----ARGUMENTS-------------------

input: 4me2know
password: secret



----OUTPUT----------------------

Z4ox6oTKnLVhf2Dc5kLLCOMcmsYzXxpY
#+end_src   

   It's also possible to decrypt like so:

#+begin_src sh
$ decrypt.sh input=Z4ox6oTKnLVhf2Dc5kLLCOMcmsYzXxpY password=secret
